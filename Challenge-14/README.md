### Tablero de ajedrez
Write a program that creates a string representing an 8 Ã— 8 grid, using new line characters to separate the lines. At each grid position there is a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.
Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:
```
 # # # # 
# # # #
 # # # # 
# # # #
  # # # #
# # # #
  # # # #
# # # #

```
When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a size = 8 binding and change the program to work at any size, outputting a grid with the given height and width.
